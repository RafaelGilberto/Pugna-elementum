## Pugna elementum

Pugma elementum is a simple game designed to test my skills in different technologies and programming languages. Being part of one of IronHack's bootcamp projects, it helped me to hone the skills needed to be a web developer.

## Introduction

This game consists of a battle between the player and the bot (computer). Each side will choose an element (earth, fire or water) and depending on the result, one side will be entitled to attack the opponent. The objective is to reduce the opponent's health (HP) to zero.  
Depending on the difficulty level chosen by the player, it is possible to increase or decrease the BOT's HP and attack damage. Below is shown a table indicating which element is stronger or weaker in relation to the other.
| | Earth |Fire|Water
|--|--|--|--
| **Loses** | Water |Earth|Fire
|--|--|--|--
|**Wins**|Fire|Water|Earth
